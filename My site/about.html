    <p>
             Sakartvelo-Georgia is a country of Transcaucasia located at the eastern end of the Black Sea on the southern flanks of the main crest of the Greater Caucasus Mountains.
            <br> It is bounded on the north and northeast by Russia, on the east and southeast by Azerbaijan, on the south by Armenia and Turkey, and on the west by the Black Sea.
            <br> Georgia includes three ethnic enclaves: Abkhazia, in the northwest (principal city Sokhumi); Ajaria, in the southwest (principal city Bat øumi); and South Ossetia, in the north (principal city Tskhinvali).
            <br> The capital of Georgia is Tbilisi (Tiflis).
            <br>The population of Georgia is about 5 million. About 1.3 million of these live in Tbilisi.
            <br>People from Georgia are called Georgians. Most of them speak Georgian as their first language, though some people also speak Azerbaijani, Armenian, Russian or other languages.
            <br>Georgians have their own unique three alphabets. They were invented by King Pharnavaz I of Iberia.
            <br>Most Georgians are Christians, but there are some Muslims and Jews as well.
            <br>The currency of Georgia is called the lari.
            <br>Georgia, attracts more and more visitors every year, due to its combination of breathtaking landscapes and the vast array of cultures
            <br> and beliefs that exist side by side in its territory. 
            <br>It is a mountainous country with a very diverse landscape in relation to its small area. 
            <br>It has arid deserts alongside thick forests, high mountains and snowy peaks, wet sub-tropical areas, wild nature and bustling cities.
            <br>A deeply complicated history has given Georgia a wonderful heritage of architecture and arts, from cave cities to ancient cathedrals to the inimitable canvases of Pirosmani. 
            <br>Tbilisi, the capital, is still redolent of an age-old Eurasian crossroads. 
            <br>But this is also a country moving forward in the 21st century, with spectacular contemporary buildings,
            <br> a minimal crime rate and ever-improving facilities for the visitors who are a growing part of its future.
