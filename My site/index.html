        My name is Nana Graff. I was born in Sukhumi Abkhazia, in Western Georgia.<br>
        I grew up on Georgian cuisine and I was always impressed how Georgian women could arrange a <br>delicious table with a wide range of different dishes in no time.
        The table in the house was always full of food and there was no guest who went home hungry.<br>
        I grew up on this tradition and as I became older and started hosting people myself, and I always made sure my table was full as well.<br>
        After we moved to Canada, (Winnipeg) there was no one to cook for me the Georgian dishes I love so much because my family stayed back home.<br>
        And so, I decided to start cooking the Georgian Cuisine by myself and wanted to share with you the wonders of this unique dining experience.<br>
