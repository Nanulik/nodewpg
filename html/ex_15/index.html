        <h1>It's not impossible': Western Canada's risk of water shortages rising</h1>
        <p>Three years of drought mean Cape Town could become the first major city in the world to run out of water. 
            <br>As the countdown to "Day Zero" continues in South Africa, 
            <br>Canadian scientists are warning that some communities here could face their own water crisis in the not-so-distant future.
            <br>Cape Town's Day Zero, when the city says it will be forced to shut off the taps and ration water to its four million citizens, 
            <br>was initially expected to come in April. Water conservation efforts have now pushed the date to late August, 
            <br>but the day the taps run dry is still coming unless the region gets some serious precipitation. 
            <br>Divided to the last drop: Inside Cape Town's water crisis
            <br>The risk that changing weather patterns pose for water supplies is one reason Canadian researcher John Pomeroy is braving frigid winter temperatures to climb a metal observation tower in the shadow of Alberta's Fortress Mountain.</p>

    <p>Pomeroy hopes Cape Town's experience will push Canadians to do more to prepare for extreme drought, 
        <br>including reducing water use and building up storage capacity to better carry communities through dry years.
        <br> "We need to manage our water much more carefully and be ready for these droughts when they hit."
        <br>Until then, Pomeroy and his team will keep watching and measuring the snow here, waiting for the inevitable â€” the day when no matter how much it snows, it won't be enough. </p>
