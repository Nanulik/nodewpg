        Satsivi (Georgian: საცივი) is a thick paste made from walnuts and served cold (‘Tsivi’ means ‘cold’ in Georgian).
        <br>  Although this is a pretty easy dish to make, it requires plenty of time.
        <br>  The dish must be prepared in advance and chilled for 24 hours before serving. </p> 
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <div>
    <ul>
        <li> 1.5 kilo whole chicken (or turkey)</li>
        <li>700 grams of walnuts</li>
        <li>5 medium sized onions</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbs of white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tsp of dried coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp of blue fenugreek</li>
        <li>1 heaped tsp of dried marigold</li>
        <li> 1 heaped tsp of dried red pepper</li>
        <li>5 crushed cloves and</li>
        <li>salt </li>
    </ul>
     <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>
        Add 2 liters of water to a deep pot and add the chicken. Heat on a medium heat until parboiled.
        <br>Remove the chicken from the pot and add to a roasting tray.
        <br> Do not discard the water that the chicken was boiled in as this will be needed later. 
        <br>Use some of the surface oil in the pot to baste the chicken. There should be no need for additional oil. 
        <br>Roast the chicken on 180 C heat until cooked. Cut the roasted chicken into medium sized pieces. 
        <br>Finely chop the onions and add to a pan with a little of the surface oil from the pot use to parboil the chicken.
        <br>Fry for 6-7 minutes. Add the fried onions to a mixing bowl and use a blender to make them smooth.
        <br> Add the onions to the pot used to par boil the chicken. Grind the walnuts. We used a meat grinder. 
        <br>If the walnuts are not old, the grinding process will produce some walnut oil. Save this. Re-grind the walnuts. 
        <br>Add 1 tsp of dried coriander, 1 tsp of blue fenugreek, 1 heaped tsp of dried marigold, 5 crushed cloves.
        <br> Mix by hand and use your hands to crush the mixture to extract any remaining oil from the walnuts. 
        <br>Save the oil. Add 1 heaped tsp of dried red pepper, 4 cloves of garlic and salt to a mortar and use a pestle to crush the ingredients.
        <br> Add the crushed red pepper/garlic/salt mixture, together with 2 tbs of white wine vinegar, to the ground walnuts and mix thoroughly. 
        <br>Gradually add water to the nut mixture from the pot used to parboil the chicken, mixing as the water is added. 
        <br>Keep adding and mixing until the mixture has a smooth consistency, once mixed, hold a sieve over the pot used to parboil the chicken and pour the mixture into the pot.
        <br> Discard any remaining large pieces left in the sieve. add the chicken pieces to the pot, bring to the boil and remove from the heat. 
        <br>Allow to completely cool before serving. Serving: Serve cold. Any excess walnut oil that was extracted during preparation can be poured onto the dish.
        <br><strong>Enjoy!!!!!</strong><br><br><br>
