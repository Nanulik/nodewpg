<div>
<ul>
        <li>For the dough:</li>
        <li>Flour – 320 g</li>
        <li>Water -125 ml</li>
        <li>Olive oil- 4 tbsp</li>
        <li>Vodka-1 tsp</li>
        <li>Sugar -1/2 tsp</li>
</ul>
<ul>
        <li>For the stuffing:</li>
        <li>Grouns beef 250g</li>
        <li>Onion ½</li>
        <li>Milk 6 tbsp</li>
        <li>Parsley flakes 1tbs</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        
</ul>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>
        In a large bowl, sift your flour. Add your sugar and salt, olive oil and vodka. Add water to the flour mixture - a small amount at a time, mixing it and kneading dough until it's even, soft and doesn't stick to your hands. 
        <br>Add a little more flour if the dough is sticky, or water if it's stiff. Place the dough aside and prepare the filling.
        <br>In a separate bowl, mix together ground beef, finely chopped onion and parsley. Season the mixture with salt and pepper and stir in milk.
        <br>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough until it is about 1/10-1/8 inch (2.5-3mm) thick. Cut circles using a small tea plate or a cake cutter.
        <br> Gather the rest of the dough into a ball and roll again. Repeat until you used all the dough.
        <br>Place about 1.5 - 2 tablespoons of the filling on one side of the circle, leaving 1/2 inch (about 1cm) space at the edges.
        <br>Fold the other half of the circle over and pinch the edges firmly together using your fingers.
        <br> Make sure there is no air inside chebureki and the edges are closed tightly.
        <br>In a large pan, heat the oil for deep frying - it should cover about 1/2 of a cheburek, reduce heat to medium and place 3 or 4 chebureki into oil. 
        <br>Fry chebureki on both sides until nicely and evenly brown, about 5-8 minutes per each side.
        <br>Drain on paper towels, serf while hot.
        <br><strong>Enjoy!!!!!</strong><br><br><br>
