    (Georgian: ქართული სამზარეულო; k’art’uli samzareulo) refers to the cooking styles and dishes created by Georgian people. 
    <br>The Georgian cuisine is unique to the country, but also carries some influences from other European and nearby Middle Eastern culinary traditions.
    <br> Each historical province of Georgia has its own distinct culinary tradition, with variations such as Megrelian, Kakhetian, and Imeretian cuisines. 
    <br>Rich with meat dishes, the Georgian cuisine also offers a variety of vegetarian dishes.
    <br>Georgian cuisine is the result of the broad interplay of culinary ideas carried along the trade routes by merchants and travelers alike.
    <br> The importance of both food and drink to Georgian culture is best observed during a feast called supra, 
    <br>when a huge assortment of dishes are prepared, always accompanied by large amounts of wine, and that can last for hours.
    <br> In a Georgian feast, the role of the tamada (toastmaster) is an important and honoured tradition.
    <br>The tamada is expected to keep the festivities moving along with toasts and songs and ensure that the wine keeps flowing!
