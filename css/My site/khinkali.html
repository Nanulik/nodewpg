   <p>
    Khinkali are a specialty of the Caucasus nation of Georgia. 
    <br>They are most often enjoyed at special restaurants where the tasty, meat-filled dumplings are served simply with a generous sprinkling of crushed black pepper.
    <br> While ground beef and lamb are the most common fillings, you can also make khinkali stuffed with chopped mushrooms or cheese

   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div>
    <ul>
        <li>For the dough:</li>
        <li>1 kg flour</li>
        <li>20g yeast</li>
        <li>500ml milk</li>
        <li>50ml oil</li>
        <li>1tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>For the stuffing:</li>
        <li>1.2kg cheese mix Feta and Muzarella</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
    </ul>
     <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>
    Pour warm milk into a bowl and add yeast. 
    <br>After 10-15 minutes add flour, salt and knead the mixture into dough. 
    <br>Then cover it with a cloth and put it in a warm place.Grind up the cheese and add the eggs.
    <br> Split the resulting paste into several parts, each being roughly 300g. 
    <br>Moisten your hands with oil and knead the fermented dough again, this will make your Khachapuri extra plump.
    <br> When the dough rises, put cheese in the middle (one 300g part of cheese per Khachapuri) and close it up. 
    <br>Put it face down on the table and roll it out lightly. 
    <br>Put the prepared Khachapuri on the baking tray and let it bake in a well-heated oven for 20-25 minutes.
    <br><strong>Enjoy!!!!!</strong><br><br><br>
