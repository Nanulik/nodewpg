<p>Fresh baked bread filled and stuffed with cheese and topped with an egg</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>For the dough:</li>
        <li>1⁄3 cups all purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. olive oil, plus more for greasing and brushing</li>
        <li>1 1⁄2 tsp. Kosher salt</li>
        <li>3⁄4 tsp. instant dry yeast</li>
        <li>1⁄4 tsp. sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>For the stuffing:</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded low moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 1⁄4 cups crumbled feta cheese </li>
        <li>2 large eggs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. unsalted butter, cubed</li>
    </ul>
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>
            Place a pizza stone in the center of the oven and preheat to 500°F.
            <br> Meanwhile, lightly oil a large bowl with olive oil and set aside.
            <br>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine yeast, sugar, olive oil, and 2⁄3 cup tepid water, flour, and salt. 
            <br>Mix on 1st speed until the dry ingredients are completely hydrated, 2-3 minutes, then increase to second speed and mix until a smooth, wet dough comes together, 3-4 minutes.
            <br>Transfer the dough to the oiled bowl and cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap. 
            <br>Set in a warm place until the dough is almost doubled in size, 50-60 minutes.
            <br> Make the filling: In a large bowl, combine the cheeses and set aside.
            <br>Crack the eggs gently and drop each of them into a separate small bowl (if the yolks break, start over).
            <br>On a lightly floured work surface, turn out the dough. Divide into two roughly 6-ounce piece and round each piece gently.
            <br> Cover the pieces loosely with plastic wrap and set aside for 15 minutes.
            <br>On a piece of lightly floured parchment paper, roll half of dough into a 10-inch circle about 1⁄8 inch thick. Spread a quarter of the cheese mixture (about 5 ounces) over the dough, leaving a 1⁄2-inch border all the way around.
            <br> On one side of the circle, tightly roll the dough about a third of the way toward the center. 
            <br>Repeat on the opposite end, leaving a 2-3 inch wide space between the two rolls. 
            <br>Pinch the two narrow ends of the rolls together and twist twice to seal, making a boat shape; place another quarter of the cheese mixture in the middle, packing down lightly.
            <br>Keeping the khachapuri atop the paper, gently slide onto a pizza peel or overturned baking sheet.
            <br> Repeat with remaining dough and cheese. Set the khachapuri aside, uncovered, for 15 minutes, until slightly puffed.
            <br>Just before baking, brush the edges of the khachapuri lightly with olive oil, then slide the breads atop the paper onto the stone, spacing them at least 3 inches apart.
            <br>Bake until the dough is lightly golden brown and the cheese is melted, 14-16 minutes. 
            <br>Open the oven door and gently pour 1 egg into the center of each boat, being careful not to bread the yolks. 
            <br>Close the oven and continue cooking until the egg whites are just set, 3–4 minutes.
            <br>Remove the breads and divide the butter among the center of each loaf; serve hot.
            <br><strong>Enjoy!!!!!</strong><br><br><br>
